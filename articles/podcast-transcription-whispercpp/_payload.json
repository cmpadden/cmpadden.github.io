--> 00:00:06.480\n >> Hi everyone. We recently launched a short engagement feedback survey for the Alter Everything\n\n00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.360\n podcast. Click the link in the episode description wherever you're listening to let us know what\n\n00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.320\n you think and help us improve our show.\n\n00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.200\n Welcome to Alter Everything, a podcast about data science and analytics culture. I'm Megan\n\n00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.440\n Dibble and today I'm talking with Nick Schrock, CTO and founder of Dagster Labs. We discussed\n\n00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.560\n data engineering trends, challenges in the field, why he started his company, and what\n\n00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.960\n makes him excited about the future of data engineering. Let's get started.\n\n00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.720\n >> Hi, Nick. It's great to have you on our show today. Thanks for being here.\n\n00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.920\n >> Thanks for having me.\n\n00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.280\n >> Yeah. Could you start off by giving an introduction to yourself for our listeners?\n\n00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.920\n >> Sure. My name is Nick Schrock. I'm the CTO and founder of Dagster Labs. There's the\n\n00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.520\n company behind Dagster, which is a data orchestration framework. Prior to doing this, I was an engineer\n\n00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.960\n at Facebook from 2009, 2017. While I was there, I found a team called product infrastructure\n\n00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.800\n whose goal was to make our application developers more efficient and productive, and a bunch\n\n00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.840\n of open source work came out of that actually, one of which was React, which I had nothing\n\n00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.040\n to do with, but actually the CEO of Dagster Labs co-created and I personally co-created\n\n00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.640\n GraphQL. So as I like to say, Pete and I were present at the creation of the full hipster\n\n00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.680\n stack. I moved on to Facebook in 2017, figuring out what to do next, and this data engineering\n\n00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.960\n and data orchestration problem really got me hooked actually quite soon after I left,\n\n00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.280\n and the rest is history. I'm sure we'll get into that more.\n","txt",[731],{"type":20,"tag":92,"props":732,"children":733},{"__ignoreMap":7},[734,742,749,757,765,772,780,788,795,803,811,818,826,834,841,849,858,866,875,884,892,901,910,918,927,936,944,953,962,970,979,988,996,1005,1014,1022,1031,1040,1048,1057,1066,1074,1083,1092,1100,1109,1118,1126,1135,1144,1152,1161,1170,1178,1187,1196,1204,1213,1222,1230,1239],{"type":20,"tag":141,"props":735,"children":736},{"class":143,"line":144},[737],{"type":20,"tag":141,"props":738,"children":739},{},[740],{"type":25,"value":741},"# out.vtt\n",{"type":20,"tag":141,"props":743,"children":744},{"class":143,"line":166},[745],{"type":20,"tag":141,"props":746,"children":747},{"emptyLinePlaceholder":282},[748],{"type":25,"value":285},{"type":20,"tag":141,"props":750,"children":751},{"class":143,"line":179},[752],{"type":20,"tag":141,"props":753,"children":754},{},[755],{"type":25,"value":756},"00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480\n",{"type":20,"tag":141,"props":758,"children":759},{"class":143,"line":197},[760],{"type":20,"tag":141,"props":761,"children":762},{},[763],{"type":25,"value":764}," >> Hi everyone.
