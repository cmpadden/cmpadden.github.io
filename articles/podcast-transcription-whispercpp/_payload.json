I'm Megan\n\n00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.440\n Dibble and today I'm talking with Nick Schrock, CTO and founder of Dagster Labs. We discussed\n\n00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.560\n data engineering trends, challenges in the field, why he started his company, and what\n\n00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.960\n makes him excited about the future of data engineering.

Could you start off by giving an introduction to yourself for our listeners?\n\n00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.920\n >> Sure. My name is Nick Schrock. I'm the CTO and founder of Dagster Labs. There's the\n\n00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.520\n company behind Dagster, which is a data orchestration framework. Prior to doing this, I was an engineer\n\n00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.960\n at Facebook from 2009, 2017. While I was there, I found a team called product infrastructure\n\n00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.800\n whose goal was to make our application developers more efficient and productive, and a bunch\n\n00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.840\n of open source work came out of that actually, one of which was React, which I had nothing\n\n00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.040\n to do with, but actually the CEO of Dagster Labs co-created and I personally co-created\n\n00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.640\n GraphQL. So as I like to say, Pete and I were present at the creation of the full hipster\n\n00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.680\n stack. I moved on to Facebook in 2017, figuring out what to do next, and this data engineering\n\n00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.960\n and data orchestration problem really got me hooked actually quite soon after I left,\n\n00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.280\n and the rest is history. I'm sure we'll get into that more.\n","txt",[879],{"type":20,"tag":92,"props":880,"children":881},{"__ignoreMap":7},[882,890,896,904,912,918,926,934,940,948,956,962,970,978,984,992,1001,1008,1017,1026,1033,1042,1051,1058,1067,1076,1083,1092,1101,1108,1117,1126,1133,1142,1151,1158,1167,1176,1183,1192,1201,1208,1217,1226,1233,1242,1251,1258,1267,1276,1283,1292,1301,1308,1317,1326,1333,1342,1351,1358,1367],{"type":20,"tag":136,"props":883,"children":884},{"class":138,"line":139},[885],{"type":20,"tag":136,"props":886,"children":887},{},[888],{"type":25,"value":889},"# out.vtt\n",{"type":20,"tag":136,"props":891,"children":892},{"class":138,"line":174},[893],{"type":20,"tag":136,"props":894,"children":895},{},[],{"type":20,"tag":136,"props":897,"children":898},{"class":138,"line":196},[899],{"type":20,"tag":136,"props":900,"children":901},{},[902],{"type":25,"value":903},"00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480\n",{"type":20,"tag":136,"props":905,"children":906},{"class":138,"line":225},[907],{"type":20,"tag":136,"props":908,"children":909},{},[910],{"type":25,"value":911}," >> Hi everyone.
