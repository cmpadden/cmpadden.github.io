We recently launched a short engagement feedback survey for the Alter Everything\n\n00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.360\n podcast. Click the link in the episode description wherever you're listening to let us know what\n\n00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.320\n you think and help us improve our show.\n\n00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.200\n Welcome to Alter Everything, a podcast about data science and analytics culture. I'm Megan\n\n00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.440\n Dibble and today I'm talking with Nick Schrock, CTO and founder of Dagster Labs. We discussed\n\n00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.560\n data engineering trends, challenges in the field, why he started his company, and what\n\n00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.960\n makes him excited about the future of data engineering. Let's get started.\n\n00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.720\n >> Hi, Nick. It's great to have you on our show today. Thanks for being here.\n\n00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.920\n >> Thanks for having me.\n\n00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.280\n >> Yeah. Could you start off by giving an introduction to yourself for our listeners?\n\n00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.920\n >> Sure. My name is Nick Schrock. I'm the CTO and founder of Dagster Labs. There's the\n\n00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.520\n company behind Dagster, which is a data orchestration framework. Prior to doing this, I was an engineer\n\n00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.960\n at Facebook from 2009, 2017. While I was there, I found a team called product infrastructure\n\n00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.800\n whose goal was to make our application developers more efficient and productive, and a bunch\n\n00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.840\n of open source work came out of that actually, one of which was React, which I had nothing\n\n00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.040\n to do with, but actually the CEO of Dagster Labs co-created and I personally co-created\n\n00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.640\n GraphQL. So as I like to say, Pete and I were present at the creation of the full hipster\n\n00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.680\n stack. I moved on to Facebook in 2017, figuring out what to do next, and this data engineering\n\n00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.960\n and data orchestration problem really got me hooked actually quite soon after I left,\n\n00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.280\n and the rest is history. I'm sure we'll get into that more.\n",[50,1921,1919],{"__ignoreMap":52},[1011,1923,1924],{},"html pre.shiki code .svObZ, html code.shiki .svObZ{--shiki-default:#B392F0}html pre.shiki code .sU2Wk, html code.shiki .sU2Wk{--shiki-default:#9ECBFF}html pre.shiki code .sDLfK, html code.shiki .sDLfK{--shiki-default:#79B8FF}html .default .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-default);background: var(--shiki-default-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-default-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-default-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-default-text-decoration);}html .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-default);background: var(--shiki-default-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-default-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-default-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-default-text-decoration);}html pre.shiki code .s95oV, html code.shiki .s95oV{--shiki-default:#E1E4E8}html pre.shiki code .sAwPA, html code.shiki .sAwPA{--shiki-default:#6A737D}",{"title":52,"searchDepth":138,"depth":138,"links":1926},[1927,1928],{"id":1555,"depth":138,"text":1556},{"id":1725,"depth":138,"text":1929},"Build whisper.cpp & Transcribe Audio",[230],"2024-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","If you've ever had the need to transcribe a podcast, lecture, or some other audio recording, it turns out it's surprisingly easy with the extremely impressive whisper.cpp project.
